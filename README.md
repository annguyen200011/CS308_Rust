# PLP1-History-and-Hello-World: Rust
## History
Name: **Rust**

First appearing in 2010, Rust was designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others.

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically _similar to C++_, but can guarantee _memory safety_. Rust has been called a systems programming language and in addition to high-level features such as functional programming it also offers mechanisms for low-level memory management.

Why rust?
- **Performance:** Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily integrate with other languages.
- **Reliability:** Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.
- **Productivity:** Rust has great documentation, a friendly compiler with useful error messages, and top-notch tooling — an integrated package manager and build tool, smart multi-editor support with auto-completion and type inspections, an auto-formatter, and more.

Rust has been adopted by major software engineering companies. Rust is used for:
- Web browsers and services: Firefox, OpenDNS, Deno, Figma,...
- Operating systems: Redox, Theseus, Google Fuchia, Stratis,...
- Other notable projects and platforms: Discord, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, _Polkadot (cryptocurrency)_,...

> Note: What I like most about rust programming language is its popularity in Dapps(Decentralize Applications) programming. I plan to program blockchain applications.
